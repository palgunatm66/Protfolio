            <h3>Dry Arecanut Sorting Using Digital Image Processing and Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>396 Days</p>
            <p>The objective of this project is to design a prototype machine that is able to sort the dry arecanut aka betelnut into different types. The main goal of the project is to decrease the human labor intense job of dry arecanut sorting to machine-oriented sorting which requires less man force and time to sort the arecanut into their different varieties.</p>
